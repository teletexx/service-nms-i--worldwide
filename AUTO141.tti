OL,4,CCovid: Lateral flow tests more accurate
OL,5,Cthan first thought, study finds
OL,6, Lateral flow tests (LFTs) are very good
OL,7, at detecting people most likely to
OL,8, spread Covid-19 and positive results
OL,9, should be trusted, say University
OL,10, College London researchers.
OL,12,FWhen LFTs were introduced, they were
OL,13,Fcriticised for being less accurate than
OL,14,FPCR tests, which are analysed in a lab.
OL,16,FBut the study found rapid tests were "a
OL,17,Fvery useful public health tool" for
OL,18,Fstopping the spread of the virus.
OL,20,FOne third of people with Covid can
OL,21,Fspread it while showing no symptoms.
